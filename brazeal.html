<h1>Emily Brazeal</h1>
<p> My favorite hobbies and activities would first be to spend time with my family. We like nature hiking, bike riding and I love to play sports. 
</p>
<p> In my own quiet time I love to read books and work on scrapbooks of my kids.  I have thousands of pictures of my family.  One day I would love to take up photography.
